**Celery** is an open-source distributed task queue system for Python. In the context of Django (and your Vestaire project), Celery is used for **running background tasks asynchronously**—that is, tasks that should not block or slow down the main web request/response cycle.

### **What Celery Is Used For:**

- **Background Processing:** Run time-consuming operations outside the HTTP request/response cycle.
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Offload tasks like sending emails, processing images, or making API calls to run in the background.
- **Scheduled Tasks:** Run periodic jobs (like cron jobs), e.g., daily reports, cleanup scripts.
- **Distributed Processing:** Scale out task execution across multiple servers or workers.

### **In Your Vestaire Project, Celery Will Be Used For:**

- **AI Image Analysis:** Offload clothing image analysis (using Gemini Vision API) so users don’t have to wait for the result during upload.
- **Image Processing:** Optimize, resize, and generate thumbnails for uploaded images in the background.
- **Other Heavy Tasks:** Any operation that is slow or could fail independently of the main app (e.g., notifications, data sync).

---

**How it works:**  
You define tasks (Python functions) and decorate them with `@shared_task` or `@app.task`. When you call these tasks, they are sent to a message broker (like Redis), and Celery workers pick them up and execute them asynchronously.

**Example:**
```python
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task
def analyze_clothing_item(item_id):
    # Long-running AI analysis here
    pass
```

**Summary:**  
Celery lets your Django app handle heavy or slow operations in the background, improving user experience and scalability.
